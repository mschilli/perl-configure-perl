=head1 NAME

Perl::Configure::Questions - Questions asked by perl's Configure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Perl::Configure::Questions;

  my $q = Perl::Configure::Questions->new();

      # Add a new (customized) token/question
  $q->add($token, $question, $answer)

      # These are used by Perl::Configure internally
  my @questions = $q->questions();
  my @patterns  = $q->patterns();
  my @tokens    = $q->tokens();
  my $by_key    = $q->by_key();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<questions()> returns a list of questions asked by perl's Configure.
C<patterns()> just runs a quotemeta() on the strings returned by
@questions. This module is used internally by Perl::Configure.

=head2 Question Format

The questions recognized by C<Perl::Configure> are stored in YAML format
in the __DATA__ section of C<Perl::Configure::Questions>:

    ...
    ---
    - vendor-specific-prefix
    - Installation prefix to use for vendor-supplied add-ons?
    - '/foobar'
    ---
    ...

The first line in each tuple (separated by --- according to YAML rules)
holds the token, C<vendor-specific-prefix> in the example above. The second
line shows the question regular expression and the third line a yet
unused 'sample answer'.

Note that regex metacharacters in the question line are B<not> escaped.
Instead, if a part of the question should match I<any> text, use the
ANY{...} clause:

    ...
    ---
    - compiler-flags-special
    - Any special flags to pass to ANY{cc -c} to compile shared library modules?
    - '-fpic'
    ---
    ...

This will cause the question matcher to accept any text instead of
C<cc -c>, which comes in handy if Configure dynamically replaces these
parts based on previous selections.
